A real-time chat application enables users to communicate instantly via text messaging over the internet. 
Key features typically include one-on-one messaging, group chats, media sharing (images, videos, voice notes), notifications, and user presence indicators (like "online" or "typing"). 
The application often supports end-to-end encryption to ensure privacy and security. 
It uses technologies like WebSockets or long-polling to maintain an open connection between the client and the server, allowing for low-latency message exchange. 
Real-time chat applications are commonly used for social networking, customer support, and team collaboration.
